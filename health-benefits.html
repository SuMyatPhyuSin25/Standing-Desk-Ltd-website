              As a modern, information-based civilization, we've moved away from the industrial and agrarian societal work patterns adopted by the generations before us that required ample physical movement. Studies show a correlation between the lack of movement over several generations and the drastic increase in potentially damaging health issues. This proves one simple but important fact: our bodies were made to move.</p>
  
  <p>The transition from sitting to standing through the use of a height-adjustable desk is a scientifically proven way to help you practice a healthier lifestyle and be more present throughout the day. By standing 15 minutes every hour, you'll start to feel the benefits of a sit-stand lifestyle without having to ramp up your exercise regimen or commit extra time to working out. If you really want to maximize your movement, using a desk bike for 30 minutes is a great option.

              Millions of employees have already reaped the benefits standing desks can offer. A study completed at the NHS determined that these desks reduced the time employees spent sitting while increasing their overall productivity and positive company culture. Similarly, an Australian study found that activity-promoting desks can improve employees' ability to pay attention, accomplish tasks, and even manage stress. Employees at various other companies have seen the same results. Apple CEO Tim Cook has ensured that all 12,000 workers at his new headquarters were issued their very own standing desk, and the government of Denmark has mandated that all office workers have the option to adopt a sit-stand work style.

            <p>
              Sitting for long periods of time has been linked to multiple health risks such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and in some cases, cancer. With a standing desk, you are able to add bouts of standing to your workday. Getting up on your feet, and even going for short walks, can help lower blood sugar and cholesterol which in turn, reduces your risk for heart disease.Staying active and increasing your movement and exercise are the best ways to fight diabetes. Inactivity, like sitting, slows down your metabolism which can increase your risk for developing type 2 diabetes. According to the American Diabetes Association, when you break up your prolonged sitting with standing and walking, it significantly reduces the postprandial glucose, insulin, and NEFA in women with diabetes. Certain cancers, especially breast cancer and colon cancer, are influenced by physical inactivity. People who are sitting for prolonged periods of time, even if they exercise regularly, have a higher risk for these types of cancers.

          <div class="obj" id="reduce-back-pain">
            <h1 class="obj-title">Reduces Back Pain and Neck Pain</h1>
           
              <p>
                People who sit at a desk all day often experience pain in their
                lower back, neck, or shoulders. Headaches are also very common
                among people who sit all day. Using a standing desk can help
                eliminate this type of pain. A recent study shows that by using a
                standing desk, pain can be reduced by half. If you have AFS,
                making this change will lower your overall stress levels and help
                to reduce the amount of inflammation throughout your body.
                One study showed that participants experienced a 32% reduction in lower back pain after using a standing desk for several weeks. Another study conducted by the CDC found that participants who used a standing desk for four weeks and participated in counseling to reduce sedentary behavior experienced a 54% improvement in back pain. Standing more often can improve your posture and take pressure off your lower spine. Evidence suggests that a standing desk can help avoid that tell-tale lower back pain after working all day. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Preventing Chronic Disease, the Take-a-Stand Project, studied a group of individuals who tried sitting, standing, or walking over the course of one week, two weeks, and four weeks. Over the progression of time, the group claimed they had less lower back pain and shoulder tension, improved posture, and overall increased mood and comfort. If you are looking to reduce your neck or back pain, a standing desk could be the perfect solution.

            <p>
              When you are standing, your brain becomes more engaged which can increase your energy. Standing helps your blood flow easily which sends more oxygen to your muscles. When you sit for long periods of time, you tend to feel tired. Standing is a great way to boost your mood and energy, which can help prevent fatigue. With all of this increased energy, you are able to stay focused on tasks and be more productive.

            <h1 class="obj-title">Increases Activity</h1>

            
            <p>
              This one is sort of a no-brainer: Standing is better for you than sitting all day. Although standing isn’t technically active, standing gives you the ability to move more while you are working. While standing at your desk, you are able to have more arm and leg movement. A lot of people who have standing desks use things such as standing mats, balance boards, treadmills, or even exercise bikes. Even though standing is better for you than sitting, you want to be sure that you have active movement while standing to achieve more health benefits. With this increased activity, standing desk users are likely to burn more calories standing than sitting during the day.

            <p>
              Studies suggest that reducing your sedentary time will increase your life expectancy. Sitting for prolonged periods of time can increase your risk of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. By reducing your sitting time, you ultimately are lowering your risk for these health issues and increasing your lifespan.

Another study from the American Cancer Society states, “Women and men who both sat more and were less physical were 94% and 48% more likely, respectively, to die compared with those who reported sitting the least and being most active.”

            <h1 class="obj-title"> Ergonomics and Better Posture</h1>

  

            <p>
              Sitting can put a lot of stress on your spine, especially if you are not practicing proper ergonomics. Proper ergonomics work hand-in-hand with reducing lower back and neck pain. By choosing to stand, your spine will elongate and become less strained allowing your back to be in a natural “S” shape. Standing will help promote better posture, while giving your spine some relief. That being said, when you stand at your desk, you need to know how to be ergonomic to reap the benefits of a standing desk. Knowing how to properly sit and stand, at your new standing desk, will be key to achieving better posture.

            <h1 class="obj-title">Better Brain Function and Circulation</h1>
            <p>
              The health of your brain is linked to the amount of blood flow in
              the brain. Inactivity reduces blood flow in the brain and affects
              the brain function as a result. Using a standing desk alleviates
              this condition by increasing blood flow. The adequate supply of
              nutrients in the brain helps in improving brain function. Another great health benefit is better circulation because it leads to other health benefits. When you choose to stand at your desk you will have better blood flow compared to sitting. Sitting can slow down your circulation which can lead to many health issues like swollen ankles, blood clots, peripheral neuropathy, and varicose veins. Standing promotes better circulation to your extremities, so you want to be sure to get up and stretch, stand, and walk around throughout the day to keep yourself healthy.

                <h1 class="obj-title">What Are the Cognitive Benefits of Using a Standing Desk?</h1>
                    <h3>Improved Employee Satisfaction</h3>

                    <p>
                        An experimental study lasting 15 weeks was conducted with adults who used standing desks for their office tasks. The study showed that discomfort was reduced, which could positively impact task performance and overall job satisfaction. It is reasonable to assume that work efficiency and productivity could be promoted in office environments with stand-capable workstations.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Increased Productivity</h3>

                    <p>
                        Employee productivity was assessed in a call-center environment for six months to compare the effects of stand-capable offices, which included standing desks.

The study used the company’s performance metric software to measure productivity. The results indicated that employees assigned to stand-capable desks exhibited higher productivity than those using traditional seated desks.

During the six months, stand-capable employees had an average of 0.5 more successful calls per hour than their seated counterparts. This increase in successful calls resulted in significant additional revenue, as the company’s revenue was based on the completion of successful calls.  
  Employees assigned to stand-capable workstations reported significantly lower body discomfort compared to seated controls and demonstrated the cognitive benefits of standing desks.
